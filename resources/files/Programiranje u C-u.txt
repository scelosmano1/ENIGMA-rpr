Programiranje u C-u
C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and
language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was
designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of
computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language is available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to
supercomputers.
