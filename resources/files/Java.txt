Java 
Java is a widely used programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed environment of the internet. It is the most popular programming
language for Android smartphone applications and is also among the most favored for the development of edge devices and the internet of things.

Java was designed to have the look and feel of the C++ programming language, but is simpler to use and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can
be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build
a small application module or applet for use as part of a webpage.
