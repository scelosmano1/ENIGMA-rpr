Healthh
ust as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again, the WHO
playeda leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception of health, not as a state,
butin dynamic terms of resiliency, in other words, as "a resource for living". 1984 WHO revised the definition of health defined it as "the extent to which
anindividual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not
theobjective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities".
