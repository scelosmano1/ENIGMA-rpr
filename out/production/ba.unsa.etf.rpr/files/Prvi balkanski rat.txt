Prvi balkanski rat
Tensions among the Balkan states over their rival aspirations to the provinces of Ottoman-controlled Rumelia, namely Eastern Rumelia, Thrace and Macedonia,
subsided somewhat following intervention by the Great Powers in the mid-19th century, aimed at securing both more complete protection for the provinces'
Christian majority and protection of the status quo. By 1867, Serbia and Montenegro had both secured independence, which was confirmed by the Treaty of Berlin (
1878). The question of the viability of Ottoman rule was revived after the Young Turk Revolution of July 1908, which compelled the Sultan to restore the
suspended Ottoman constitution.
