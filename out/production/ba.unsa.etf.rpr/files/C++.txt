C++
C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore
possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid
language.

C++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called "C
with classes" as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of "classes." However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.

It is pronounced "see-plus-plus."
